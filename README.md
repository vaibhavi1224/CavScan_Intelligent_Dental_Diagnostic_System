# CavScan: Intelligent Dental Diagnostic System

## Overview
CavScan is an AI-powered dental diagnostic system designed to assist dentists in identifying and assessing oral diseases. Using a deep learning model trained on dental images, CavScan provides probability-based assessments of potential conditions, helping streamline the diagnostic process.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes the **VGG16** architecture for image classification.
- **Accuracy**: Achieves **79% accuracy** on the test dataset.
- **AI-Powered Diagnosis**: Predicts potential dental conditions based on image analysis.
- **Structured Reports**: Generates concise and professional dental reports for easy interpretation.
- **Confidence Scores**: Provides probability-based assessments for detected conditions.

## How It Works
1. **Image Input**: The system takes a dental X-ray or intraoral image as input.
2. **Preprocessing**: The image is processed and prepared for model inference.
3. **Disease Prediction**: The VGG16 model analyzes the image and assigns probability scores to potential conditions.
4. **Report Generation**: A structured report is generated with detected conditions and confidence scores.
5. **Recommendations**: The report includes suggested next steps for further examination or treatment.

## Installation
### Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
